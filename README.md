### Software for calculating the Value-at-Risk of commercial buildings in earthquakes

This software calculates the financial/life-safety risk to commercial buildings in earthquake-prone areas, part of the design and risk assessment process for new buildings. This project is also a proof-of-concept in converting research to a widely-usable tool as fast as possible.

### Features:
* Server-based SaaS model (local mode available)
* parallel and scalable
* json HTTP api

This project is the server-based computation engine. The client user interface is located [here] (https://github.com/statX/openslat-nodejs-one)
